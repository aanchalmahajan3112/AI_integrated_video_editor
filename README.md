1. Set up a web interface:
   Create a web interface using Flask. Flask is a web framework for building web applications in Python.
   Define route for homepage and another one for video uploading.
   Create and render HTML & CSS templates and run the flask app.

2. Upload and store videos:
   Create an HTML Form for Video Upload.
   Handle the Video Upload in Flask Route.

   Store the uploaded videos on application server's local file system or utilize cloud-based object storage services like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage.

3. Create a metadata file:
   Metadata files are files that store additional information about the associated data or objects.
   For this we have to specify the metadata fields like the title, the date, the author, and the keywords,etc.
   Extract metadata from videos using AI tools like Google Cloud Vision API, Amazon Rekognition.
   Save the file in the CSV, JSON, or XML formats.

4. Video Processing Pipeline:
   We can create a pipeline to carry out the following steps:
   
   a. Generating Script - We can use Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models, such as DeepSpeech or Google's Speech-to-Text API for automatically generating 
   script out of videos.
   Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is a technology that is designed to convert spoken language into text. They are trained on large datasets of spoken language and have
   state-of-the-art accuracy in transcribing audio to text, making them suitable for generating a script from spoken words in videos.
   DeepSpeech is a comprehensive automatic speech recognition (ASR) system which uses deep neural networks, specifically recurrent neural networks (RNNs). These models are trained on
   a large dataset of spoken language to learn the patterns and relationships between audio input and corresponding text transcriptions.
   Google's Speech-to-Text API is a service provided by Google Cloud which can transcribe spoken words from various audio sources, such as audio recordings, live streaming,
   or telephony conversations.

   b.Name Entity Recognition  - Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that focuses on identifying and classifying
   named entities (i.e.,names, specific objects, places, organizations, dates, quantities, and other proper nouns) within a text.
   For this purpose we can use models like spaCy or BERT-based models for recognizing entities in the script.
   
   c.Sentiment Analysis -  Foe sentiment analysis the Pre-trained models like transformer-based models can be used.
   Transformer-based models, like BERT, GPT, and their variants, are deep learning models that use attention mechanisms and neural networks for understanding language. These
   models have been pre-trained on massive text corpora and they take into account the entire sentence or document when determining sentiments.
   
   Why NER & Sentiment Analysis is required- These are required for content categorization, sentiment-based editing, and script analysis.

   d. Facial Detection- A facial detection model is integrated to identify and mark timestamps when faces are present in the video.
    OpenCV's pre-trained Haar Cascades, deep learning-based models like Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD), or Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNNs) can be used for
   detecting faces in the video.
   Haar Cascade Classifiers, are a machine learning object detection method used to identify objects, detect faces or patterns within images or video. They are trained using machine
   learning techniques, particularly the AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) algorithm.
   SSD is a single-shot object detection model that efficiently detects objects of various sizes and shapes in real-time and also provide information about their location (bounding
   boxes) and class labels (e.g., car, person, dog).
   R-CNN, or Region-based Convolutional Neural Network, is an object detection method in computer vision that uses a combination of region proposals and convolutional neural networks
   to identify and locate objects within an image.

   e.Video editing- For video editing tasks like cropping, concatenation, and special effects, we can use FFmpeg. FFmpeg is a powerful and widely used multimedia framework with a range
   of video processing capabilities. It's highly efficient and well-suited for batch video editing tasks.


6. Integrate all models and Deploy-  Integrate all the models and deploy it on the cloud plaforms like AWS, Heroku or Azure
